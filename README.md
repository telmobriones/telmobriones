## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student and researcher at HiTZ Center at UPV/EHU, where I focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). At the same time, I'm pursuing a master's in Hizkuntzaren Analisia eta prozesamendua / Language Analysis and Processing (HAP/LAP), also in UPV/EHU. My background is in Informatics with a specialization in Computer Science.
